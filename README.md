Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================


>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
>The outcome is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

>One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing . Companies like >Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. >The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the >Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

>
>Here are the datasets for the project:

>https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
>
Following files are available in this repository:
===========================================================
>
> 1. UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip - Dataset containing all training and test data 
> 2. run_analysis.R -  script for performing the analysis, and 
> 3. tidy_data.txt - a final outcome i.e. tidy data set as described in Codebook.md
> 4. Codebook.md - an autogenerated code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data
> 5. Codebook.Rmd - Codebook R Markdown file that is executed from run_analysis.R to generate Codebook.md
> 6. Codebook.html - an autogenerated code book html that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that has been performed to clean up the data

>
Data and Cleaning Logic - run_analysis.R
===============================================
>
> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
> 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

>
Steps to reproduce this project
===============================================
>
> 1. Download and extract the dataset zip file UCI HAR Dataset.zip into current working directory
> 2. Make sure you have following files in UCI HAR Dataset directory
>   a) features.txt, features_info.txt and activity_labels.txt in UCI HAR Dataset directory
>   b) "test" subdirectory containing X_test.txt, Y_test.txt and subject_test.txt
>   c) "train" subdirectory containing X_train.txt, Y_train.txt and subject_train.txt
> 3. Open the R Studio and make sure you have "datasets", "data.table", "reshape2" packages installed
>   a) If these packages are not installed, please make sure you have access to internet to download these packages.
>   b) If these packages are not installed, it will install when you run the script run_analysis.R
> 4. Make sure the current working directory contains run_analysis.R and UCI HAR DataSet directory
> 5. Run "run_analysis.R"and please wait for execution to finish

>
Outputs of the successful run_analysis.R run
===============================================
> 

> 1. tidy_data.txt file containing valid data (i.e.181 rows with this data set) including first row containing column headings
> 2. Codebook.md & Codebook.html containing variable Names, steps takem and any transformations done in run_analysis.r
